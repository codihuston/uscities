# Purpose

The purpose of this app is to display trending Google Searches and Twitter
Searches by State in several different angles. The city data that is output
from this project is already exported at `mongodb\dump\locations.json`. You
can download that directly and use it for your own purposes.

If for whatever reason you want to actually run this project yourself,
feel free to follow the documentation mentioned below for instructions on
developing on this project.
